# Simple React Listing App

A React SPA that communicates with a REST API, built with json-server, to display a list of information.
Currently hitting two endpoints, `/sites` and `/clients`.
Extra features include pagination and filtering.

Using React Router for routing and using Styled Components as our CSS pre-processor to have locally scoped styles.
